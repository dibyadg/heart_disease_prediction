#  Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

##  Overview
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Early detection enables interventions that save lives.  
This project replicates a **real-world analyst workflow**: taking a raw clinical dataset, exploring patterns, engineering features, and evaluating multiple ML algorithms. The goal is to demonstrate **end-to-end data science practice** not to build a production medical tool.

---

##  Objectives
- Explore and clean the UCI Heart Disease dataset.
- Perform **EDA** to understand correlations between clinical features and heart disease.
- Apply **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and **Random Forest** models.
- Compare model performance using **10-fold cross-validation**.
- Document insights and next steps as a **case study** for recruiters.
